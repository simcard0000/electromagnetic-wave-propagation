# electromagnetic-wave-propagation
ðŸ“Š Playing around with matplotlib for physics!

A Gr. 12 final project turned out to be a good opportunity to mess with python, and python libraries such as matplotlib and numpy, tkinter, multiprocessing, and pynput. The result of this is a 3D visual of electromagnetic waves which can be manipulated. Many resources were utilized in the making, such as the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and other documentations for the libraries, how to freeze python files and make executables out of them, Stack Overflow questions such as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33623263/how-to-update-3d-arrow-animation-in-matplotlib) during the process of making, and [matplotlib example code](https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/simple_3danim.html).
